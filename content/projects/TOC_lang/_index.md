## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a Toy Language designed to explore the principles of compiler design. Built using Python, Lex, and Yacc, the language includes key components such as a Lexer and Parser. The project is open for contributors who are interested in expanding the languageâ€™s capabilities. This Toy Language is specifically tailored for individuals studying the Theory of Computation (TOC) or those looking to better understand its concepts in a visual and hands-on way. The primary goal of the project is to help users learn compiler design principles through an engaging, practical approach.

## Key Features

- **Lexer and Parser**: The core components are already developed, with a working Lexer to tokenize input and a Parser to analyze the structure of the code.
- **Compiler Design Exploration**: The language is designed to assist in learning and experimenting with compiler design concepts.
- **Open for Contributions**: The project is looking for contributors to help expand and improve the language.
- **Educational Tool**: Tailored for those studying the Theory of Computation, providing a practical way to grasp complex concepts.
