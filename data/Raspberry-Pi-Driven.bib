abstract="Addressing the growing demand for affordable assistive technology for the visually impaired, this paper introduces an innovative system for real-time image-to-Braille conversion, utilizing optical character recognition and Raspberry Pi 4 technology. The system captures text from images and converts it into Braille characters, embossed by solenoids for tactile reading. The research aims to enhance inclusivity in education and daily life for visually impaired individuals, with a particular focus on developing countries like India.",
